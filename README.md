# Welcome to InventoryQR

To use InventoryQR, you will need to populate the config.php file with your database credentials, as well as create a database using the NewInstance.sql template.

## What is InventoryQR for?

InventoryQR is a moderately specialised piece of software, though with a reasonably low cost of usage in terms of hardware required. One needs to have access to a barcode reader (1D barcode readers work great and cost ~£15), and the interface for the barcode reading device is designed for a 3.5" low quality display, such as a 3.5" display that can be found for ~£8 with a case for the Raspberry Pi. I am using [this one](https://uk.banggood.com/Geekcreit-3_5-inch-TFT-LCD-Touch-Screen-Protective-Case-Touch-Pen-Kit-For-Raspberry-Pi-3B3B2B-p-1391232.html) combined with an RPi 2B and a USB WiFi chip. I load the website using the built in Chromium browser in kisok mode.

## Why did I develop InventoryQR?

It is designed to be a cost effective and easy way to keep track of the food stored in your cupboard and freezer, as we have a large and unweildy cupboard along with a chest freezer that's impossible to search through properly when you are compiling a shopping list.

## Why's it called InventoryQR?

I need to change the name but in the meantime, that's what I called it as initially I planned to print QR codes for everything, before thinking using the already existing codes on most items is a much better way. :)
